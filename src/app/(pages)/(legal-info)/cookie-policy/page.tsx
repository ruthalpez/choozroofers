            We use cookies to help improve your experience of our website at
            https://choozroofers.com. This cookie policy is part of Chooz
            Painters's privacy policy. It covers the use of cookies between your
            device and our site.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also provide basic information on third-party services we may
            use, who may also use cookies as part of their service. This policy
            does not cover their cookies.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you don’t wish to accept cookies from us, you should instruct
            your browser to refuse cookies from https://choozroofers.com. In
            such a case, we may be unable to provide you with some of your

          <h2 className="heading-secondary font-poppins">What is a cookie?</h2>
          <p>
            A cookie is a small piece of data that a website stores on your
            device when you visit. It typically contains information about the
            website itself, a unique identifier that allows the site to
            recognise your web browser when you return, additional data that
            serves the cookie’s purpose, and the lifespan of the cookie itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cookies are used to enable certain features (e.g. logging in), track
            site usage (e.g. analytics), store your user settings (e.g. time
            zone, notification preferences), and to personalize your content
            (e.g. advertising, language).
          </p>
          <p>
            Cookies set by the website you are visiting are usually referred to
            as first-party cookies. They typically only track your activity on
            that particular site.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cookies set by other sites and companies (i.e. third parties) are
            called third-party cookies. They can be used to track you on other
            websites that use the same third-party service.

            Targeting/advertising cookies
          </h2>
          <p>
            Targeting/advertising cookies help determine what promotional
            content is most relevant and appropriate to you and your interests.
            Websites may use them to deliver targeted advertising or limit the
            number of times you see an advertisement. This helps companies
            improve the effectiveness of their campaigns and the quality of
            content presented to you. These cookies may be set by the website
            you’re visiting (first-party) or by third-party services.
            Targeting/advertising cookies set by third-parties may be used to
            track you on other websites that use the same third-party service.
          </p>
          <p>We use targeting/advertising cookies on our site.</p>

            Consent Manager. The Cookie Consent Manager allows you to select

            with the services on our Website.

            You may also be able to set or amend your cookie preferences by

            browser (typically in the "help" section). If you choose to refuse
            or disable cookies you may still use the Website, though some of the
